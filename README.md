# custom-cv

This repository contains a custom latex class for a cv.
Documentation can be found in the example \texttt{cv.tex} and \texttt{cv.pdf}.

To use this class copy the \texttt{customcv.cls} file into your working directory
and use it as shown in the example.

If you face issues with the page numbering or other things consider rebuilding
twice as some LaTeX commands need that.
